Go Incognito: A Guide to Security, Privacy, &amp; Anonymity

Go Incognito is a video-based course teaching users of varying experience levels about privacy, security, and anonymity. It’s a  part of my goal to educate users around the world and provide them with not only a tutorial for improving their data habits, but to transform a user’s way of thinking about why, where, when, and how to treat their data and personal information. To top it off, Go Incognito is available free to watch, is shareable to the public through a Creative Commons license, and will one day include a premium version for users who want more perks. It’s been in production since May, 2018, and is still in the process of being released.
